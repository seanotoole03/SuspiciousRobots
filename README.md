# SuspiciousRobots

A place for students of Fall2020 CS557 at Boise State University to share their source code and discuss solutions and approaches to the problems presented. The class may be over, but the competition has just begun! (Kidding, I'm sure none of us have much time to work on these in graduate school, but it'd be a lot of fun to try and make an optimal bot for future classes to defeat!)
